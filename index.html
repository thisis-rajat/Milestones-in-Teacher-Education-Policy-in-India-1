<h3 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Munro’s Teacher Training Proposal</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">As early as 1826, Sir Thomas Munro, then Governor of Madras, recognized the need for trained teachers in India’s schools. He proposed establishing teacher training schools in each district (collectorate) to supply qualified “native teachers” for the expanding school system.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Munro’s plan recommended government support (funding and stipends) for training local candidates as teachers.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">This included opening special schools to prepare teachers, rather than importing teachers from England, thus laying groundwork for an indigenous teacher education system.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Munro’s initiative led to early funding for teacher training by the colonial administration. Though limited in scope, it set a precedent for formal teacher education in India, influencing later policies like Wood’s Despatch (1854) that institutionalized teacher training across presidencies.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Wood’s Despatch (Magna Carta of Indian Education)</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Sir Charles Wood’s Despatch of 1854 was a landmark policy for education in British India. It devoted special attention to teacher education as the linchpin of quality schooling, earning the nickname “Magna Charta of English Education in India.”</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Wood’s Despatch advocated establishing dedicated normal schools in each province to train teachers.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It introduced a pupil-teacher system (apprenticeship model) where aspiring teachers (pupil-teachers) would receive stipends and hands-on training under experienced masters.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It also recommended certificates and employment guarantees for those who completed training, incentivizing the teaching profession.</li>
</ul>
<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Despatch led to the founding of teacher training institutions across India’s presidencies.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">By 1882, 106 normal schools were in operation (including some exclusively for women).</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The policy firmly established teacher training as a responsibility of the state, creating a cadre of locally trained teachers and setting standards, such as requiring a teaching certificate for salary grants to schools, that professionalized teaching in India.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Lord Stanley’s Despatch</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">In 1859, Sir Edward Stanley (Secretary of State for India) issued a despatch reinforcing the importance of indigenous teacher training. This policy built on Wood’s Despatch by further discouraging reliance on England for teachers and solidifying local training efforts.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Lord Stanley’s Despatch insisted that teachers for Indian schools should be trained locally (particularly for vernacular schools) rather than imported.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It tied government grants to teacher qualifications: only schools with certified trained teachers were eligible for certain salary grants.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">This created a clear incentive for schools to have trained staff.</li>
</ul>
<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The 1859 Despatch gave a strong impetus to teacher-training programs in India.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The linkage of grants to trained teachers meant a rapid increase in demand for teacher education.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">By the early 1880s, the policy had helped expand the network of normal schools and firmly established the norm that teaching positions required professional training.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Hunter Commission (Indian Education Commission)</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Indian Education Commission of 1882, popularly known as the Hunter Commission, was the first comprehensive review of education in India. It recognized that improving teacher training was crucial for elevating educational standards.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Hunter Commission authorized and formalized distinct training programs for elementary and secondary teachers.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It recommended creating a separate secondary teacher training program with rigorous examinations in the principles and practice of teaching.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Passing this exam was made mandatory for permanent appointment as a teacher in any government or aided secondary school.</li>
</ul>
<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Acting on these recommendations, the late 19th century saw the establishment of six new stand-alone teacher training colleges.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">These colleges awarded a Licentiate in Teaching (LT) diploma, equivalent to a degree.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Additionally, about 50 training schools for secondary teachers emerged.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">By century’s end, India had a diversified institutional framework for teacher education – normal schools for primary teachers, secondary training schools, and colleges – in both government and missionary/private sectors.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Hunter Commission’s push for qualified teachers greatly professionalized teaching and laid the foundation for a structured teacher education system.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Government of India Education Policy Resolution (Curzon’s Reforms)</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Lord Curzon’s 1904 resolution on education policy aimed to improve quality at all levels of education, with teacher training as a central focus. Curzon saw poorly trained teachers as a cause of low educational standards and sought to standardize and modernize teacher education.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The 1904 resolution set standards for recognizing schools, including mandates on teacher qualifications and training facilities.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It recommended strengthening training colleges for secondary teachers by equipping them with better facilities and linking each college with a practicing model school.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The duration of training was specified: one year for graduates and two years for undergraduates entering teaching.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Training curricula were to tightly integrate educational theory with practical teaching skills.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">For primary teacher training, it called for expanding normal schools (especially in Bengal) and set a two-year minimum course focused on preparing teachers for rural schools.</li>
</ul>
<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Curzon’s reforms led to qualitative improvements in teacher preparation.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Training colleges and schools upgraded their infrastructure and curriculum to meet the new norms.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The insistence on practice teaching (through attached model schools) professionalized the practicum component of teacher education.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Overall, the 1904 resolution helped create a more systematic and quality-oriented teacher training regime in India, directly linking teacher qualifications to school recognition and funding.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Education Policy Resolution</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Government of India’s 1913 resolution on education policy further emphasized teacher qualifications as non-negotiable for modern schooling. It underscored that no teacher should be allowed to teach without proper training and certification.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The resolution proposed that teachers be recruited from the same social class/community as their students (to ensure cultural connect), but only if they had at least a middle school (vernacular) pass and one year of formal teacher training.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It stressed periodic revision of teacher training curricula.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Another innovative suggestion was fostering professional learning communities: teacher-training college staff were urged to regularly exchange ideas and visit each other’s institutions.</li>
</ul>
<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">This policy reinforced the principle that teaching is a skilled profession requiring certification.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Provinces began enforcing qualification requirements more strictly.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The emphasis on curriculum renewal and inter-college exchanges sowed the seeds for a more dynamic teacher education culture.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It paved the way for a more unified standard in teacher training across British India.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Calcutta University Commission (Sadler Commission)</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Chaired by Dr. Michael Sadler, this commission primarily reviewed higher education, but it also made significant recommendations for teacher education as part of the university system.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Sadler Commission suggested that universities should take an active role in teacher training.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It recommended establishing Departments of Education at universities (such as Dacca and Calcutta) and introducing Education as an optional subject at the Intermediate, B.A., and M.A. levels.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">This meant prospective teachers could study education academically during their college years, integrating content knowledge with pedagogical theory.</li>
</ul>
<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Commission’s ideas had a positive impact on teacher education programs.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Following its report, universities started engaging in teacher preparation. For example, Mysore University established a Faculty of Education in 1925.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">By bringing teacher education into mainstream universities, the Sadler Commission helped elevate the intellectual and professional standards of teacher training, influencing later moves to integrate teacher education with higher education institutions.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Nation-Building and Basic Education (Gandhian initiatives)</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The 1920s saw indigenous movements which indirectly shaped teacher development. Mahatma Gandhi’s call for Nai Talim (Basic Education) in 1937–38 introduced a radically different approach requiring new teacher training paradigms. Though not a government commission, the Wardha Conference (1937) and the Zakir Husain Committee (1938) on basic education were key Indian-led initiatives influencing TPD.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;"><li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Basic Education envisioned schooling up to grade 8 centered on handicrafts, self-sufficiency, and holistic development.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">To implement this, teachers needed training in craft-based, experiential learning methods.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi took up the challenge – in 1938 it established a Teachers’ College for Basic Education, arguably the first program to train teachers in learning-by-doing methods.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Similar training centers were set up at Wardha (Maharashtra) and Gandhigram (Tamil Nadu).</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Curricula for these training programs stressed craft skills, integration of work and curriculum, use of mother tongue, and development of social values.</li>
</ul>
<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;"><li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">These efforts were the earliest attempts to “indigenize” teacher education, aligning it with Indian realities and nationalist aspirations.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">They demonstrated that teachers could be trained to deliver a radically different curriculum focused on self-reliance and social reconstruction.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Although basic education did not scale nationwide under colonial rule, it influenced post-independence thinking on work-experience in curriculum and showed the importance of preparing teachers for the local context.</li>

<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Hartog Committee (1929) was appointed to examine problems of education (notably the high dropout rate in primary schools) in the wake of rapid expansion of schools during the 1920s. While focused on primary education quality, it inevitably addressed teacher training.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;"><li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">For primary teacher training, Hartog recommended extending the duration of training programs (to impart deeper skills) and ensuring training institutes were adequately staffed.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Importantly, it highlighted that improving teachers’ service conditions (salary, career prospects) was essential to attract and retain talent.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Hartog also suggested selecting primary teachers from local rural communities.</li>

<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;"><li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">These recommendations led to concrete measures.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">In the 1930s, provincial governments initiated in-service training programs for primary teachers.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) adopted Hartog’s guidelines in 1943, standardizing teacher training durations: 2 years for pre-primary and primary, 3 years for middle-school, etc.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">This brought uniformity to teacher education across India.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The emphasis on in-service education acknowledged that learning for teachers doesn’t stop at initial training – a principle that would gain prominence in independent India’s TPD policies.</li>

<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Abbott-Wood Report (1937) mainly examined vocational education, but it also contributed a forward-looking perspective on teacher education. Authored by British experts, the report’s insights were ahead of their time in teacher training.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;"><li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Abbott-Wood recommended a three-year teacher training course after high school, combining general higher education with professional training – essentially an early call for integrated teacher education programs.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The report also introduced the idea of periodic refresher courses for in-service teachers.</li>
</ul>
<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;"><li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">While colonial authorities did not implement a 3-year training nationwide, the concept influenced educational planners.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The notion of integrated teacher degrees would resurface in independent India (e.g., the four-year programs in the 1960s and again in NEP 2020).</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The idea of regular in-service refresher training was validated and later became standard practice in national programs.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">In essence, the Abbott-Wood Report planted seeds for longer pre-service training and continuous in-service development, recognizing teaching as a career of lifelong learning.</li>

<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was established by the Government of India in 1961 as an apex body for education. While not a commission, this institutional development was crucial for teacher training in India.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>Key Role in TPD:</summary></details>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">NCERT set up Regional Institutes of Education (RIEs) in different zones of India to serve as model teacher education colleges (building on ideas from the 1953 Commission and Ford team). These RIEs pioneered integrated teacher education programs and updated pedagogy. NCERT also absorbed and coordinated existing national research and training efforts, developing model curricula, syllabi, and teaching materials. Through its Department of Teacher Education, NCERT became an advisory leader, conducting in-service teacher training at national scale (e.g., summer institutes, orientation programs) and shaping pre-service teacher education content.</p>

<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The formation of NCERT provided India with a dedicated institution to professionalize teacher education.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It facilitated consistent national standards and innovations: NCERT’s curriculum frameworks for schools (starting 1975) and related teacher education frameworks (through the NCTE, which was initially under NCERT) guided states in reforming teacher training.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The RIEs served as laboratories for new teacher education models (like the four-year B.Ed., and later two-year B.Ed. experiments), many of which influenced policy.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">NCERT also conducted research that fed into major commissions (like Kothari Commission) and into training design (such as activity-based learning methods), thereby deeply shaping both in-service and pre-service teacher development across India.</li>

<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">By decentralizing training to sub-district levels, SSA helped contextualize teacher development – trainers could address local language issues or specific learning gaps.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The period 2003–2010 saw a flurry of activity-based and child-centric methodologies enter classrooms as teachers were trained in new approaches aligned with National Curriculum Framework 2005.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">However, the outcomes were mixed: while teacher attendance in training was high, multiple assessments (like ASER, etc.) indicated that learning levels did not rise commensurately.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Nonetheless, SSA permanently changed the TPD landscape: continuous in-service teacher training and onsite support became an expected norm.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Even after SSA merged into the broader Samagra Shiksha in 2018, the structures and practices it established (BRC/CRC system, annual teacher training budgets, etc.) remain the backbone of in-service teacher professional development in India.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">National Curriculum Framework (NCF 2005)</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">NCERT’s National Curriculum Framework 2005, though a school curriculum document, had profound implications for teacher development. It espoused a shift to constructivist, child-centered pedagogy, which required reorientation of both pre-service and in-service teacher education.</p>
<div class="read-more">
<details open="open"><summary>💡 Key Points:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">NCF 2005 redefined the role of the teacher from an information-deliverer to a facilitator of learning.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It recommended that teacher education curricula be redesigned to give trainee teachers ample opportunities to observe children, engage in interactive learning, and reflect on the social-cultural context of education.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Trainees should learn to “construct knowledge” along with learners, rather than just implementing given scripts.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The framework highlighted that a teacher must act as a mentor, facilitator, and co-learner – organizing activities, guiding exploration, and addressing diverse needs, instead of purely lecturing.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It also pointed out that teacher training should integrate theory with practice, enabling teachers to contextualize theory in real classrooms and become reflective practitioners.</li>
</ul>
<details open="open"><summary>📈 Impact:</summary></details>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">NCF 2005’s vision directly led to a nationwide push for training in new pedagogical techniques.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Through SSA, lakhs of in-service teachers were trained on NCF’s themes (group work, experiments, projects, etc.).</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">More structurally, NCF 2005 became a catalyst for NCTE to develop a fresh National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education (NCFTE) 2009 that aligned teacher education with these constructivist principles.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Many colleges of education started revising their B.Ed syllabi (even before NCFTE) to include more practicum, school-based projects, and courses on child development and learning theories as envisaged by NCF 2005.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The framework thus helped bridge the gap between modern curriculum demands and teacher preparation, ultimately moving India’s teacher professional development discourse toward producing teachers who are innovative, reflective, and sensitive to child-centric learning.</li>

<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">RTE 2009 put teacher qualifications and accountability on a legal footing.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">States ramped up efforts to train or remove unqualified para-teachers.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The introduction of TET from 2011 onwards has significantly influenced pre-service training – teacher education institutes had to better prepare their students for these tests, leading to greater focus on foundational knowledge and teaching aptitude.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The TET also set a common benchmark for teacher knowledge across India.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Moreover, RTE led to increased demand for teacher education as thousands sought to upgrade qualifications, and it spurred the growth of online/blended training programs.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Ensuring every school meets PTR norms meant continuous recruitment and induction training of new teachers, often under missions like SSA.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">While challenges in compliance remained, by 2015 the proportion of untrained teachers had fallen sharply.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">RTE thus enforced the idea that every teacher must be professionally trained and continually supported, reinforcing the importance of both pre-service qualifications and in-service development as part of the right to quality education.</li>

<ul style="margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style-position: outside;">
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">JVC urged increasing public investment in teacher education, ensuring capacity in underserved regions, and integrating teacher education with mainstream universities.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">It also recommended lengthening pre-service training from one year to two.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">Another major suggestion was that each teacher education institution should adopt a “laboratory” school.</li>

<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">The Ministry accepted many recommendations, leading to the NCTE 2014 Regulations that made B.Ed a two-year program from 2015 onward.</li>
<li style="font-size: 16px; margin: 0 0 8px 0;">States also curtailed licensing of new private B.Ed colleges and increased scrutiny on existing ones.</li>
